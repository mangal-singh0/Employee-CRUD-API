# Final Demo

Spring Boot CRUD sample with MongoDB, JPA, and Swagger/OpenAPI docs.

## Requirements
- Java 17
- Maven 3.9+
- MongoDB running locally (default connection string)

## Run Locally
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
The API will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Swagger UI
After the app is running, open:
```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
for interactive documentation generated by Springdoc.

## Build
```sh
mvn clean package
```
Creates `target/final_demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Frontend (React + Tailwind)
Located in `frontend/`.

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev   # serves at http://localhost:5173
```

The UI expects the API at `http://localhost:8080`. Override by creating `.env` in `frontend/`:
```
VITE_API_BASE=http://your-api-host:8080
```

Then reload the dev server or rebuild (`npm run build`).
